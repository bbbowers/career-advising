# Career Advising
## Find your niche
- There are a bunch of jobs out there, and it can be overwhelming considering them all
- Additionally, doing something you hate is a good way to burn out
- But doing something you love could buy you a few more years of work
- Figure out what you enjoy and don't enjoy (this can change over time!)
    - Find causes that you care about, and look for jobs within/around those causes
    - Take a variety of classes, get interested, do projects outside of class
- Picking somewhere you want to live can help you find that niche too
    - If you want to live in Maine, narrow your search to Maine jobs/careers!
## Portfolio building
- Hold onto all of your projects and keep them in a centralized location
    - Keep your in-class and personal projects in a place you can find them easily!
- These will be talking points in conversation as well as opportunities for you to talk about the _hard stuff_ you've done in class
- Choose your favorite ones to showcase on a webpage: you should know these inside and out and be ready for in-depth conversations around them
## Finding jobs (and internships)
- Look for university hire programs
    - Some companies will not consider your application if you apply through normal listings and they have a university program
- Talk with friends and family
- I like google's job search as it aggregates across sites
    - I prefer applying directly through the company's website, I would expect these listings to be more up-to-date than other sources
- Be open to other job titles: our field is primarily driven by "software engineer" and its variants, but you might also consider:
    - Test engineer, operations engineer, technical product/program manager
- If you go to a general career fair, you'll have to market yourself, so try these questions:
    - "Do you have jobs that are looking for <MY MAJOR HERE>?"
    - "Do you have projects or work that need technical support?"
    - "Do you have repetitive tasks that take a lot of time?"
    - "Can I contact you with any ideas I might have about making your work easier for you?"
- Spend your time wisely, while you can cast a wide net, it can be overwhelming and time-consuming
- It's a bit of a waiting game
    - Some companies review resumes right away, other places send interview invitations en masse monthly or quarterly
    - Send your application and set a 2-4week reminder (or forget about it), try following up once via email and then move on

## Common topics for interviews
- Know the job/company you're interviewing with
    - Know their history, how do they originate, how have they been progressing, what do you think the next steps are?
    - Know their competitors
    - Know technologies that they are invested in or using
- If it's a larger company, _expect_ Algorithms and Data structures questions
    - Be relatively comfortable with the limitations and use cases of data structures
    - Be prepared to give some Big-O analyses
- Be prepared to write some code or build a project live
    - Practice using [leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com)/[codewars](https://www.codewars.com)/[kattis](https://open.kattis.com)/[neetcode](https://neetcode.io/), or making a project from scratch with _No googling and No AI_
        - Bonus points if you only use notepad (NO IDE!)
    - Your solution doesn't have to be perfectly efficient (bonus points if it is) 
        - it needs to run, be correct, and you need to be able to talk someone through it in plain english
- Curate your portfolio for the position, if it's a web dev position, put your web projects front and center.

## Resume-building
- Work with the Career Center
- Bring your portfolio so that you can talk about those projects and put them in your resume
- Tailor your resume for the job you're applying to
- Get friends and family to look at your resume

## Graduate School
- If you have senioritis, don't hurt yourself with more school.
- If you love school and want more of it, consider graduate school!
- If you don't know if you want to do graduate school, consider doing some undergraduate research to try it out!
    - Talk to Dr. Gaby at the summer opportunities, internships, and REU table
    - Talk to Dr. Hamid at the Faculty Research table
- If you're considering a career in academia
    - More school!
- If you want to have some more time to develop your interests and have control over the projects you work on
    - More school!
- If you want to work at a competitive company that does specialized or research work
    - More school!
