Finding jobs (and internships)
    - _Look for university hire programs_
        - Some companies will not consider your application if you apply through normal listings and they have a university program
    - Talk with friends and family
        - Sometimes it's not what you know but who you know
    - There are a bunch of websites- I like google's job search as it aggregates across sites
    - If you go to a general career fair, you'll have to market yourself, so try these questions:
        - "Do you have jobs that are looking for <MY MAJOR HERE>?"
        - "Do you have projects or work that need technical support?"
        - "Do you have repetitive tasks that take a lot of time?"
        - "Can I contact you with any ideas I might have about making your work easier for you?"
    - Spend your time wisely, while you can cast a wide net, it can be overwhelming and time-consuming
    - It's a bit of a waiting game
        - Some companies review resumes right away, other places send interview invitations en masse monthly or quarterly
        - Send it and set a 2-4week reminder, try following up once via email and then move on

Common topics for interviews
    - Know the job/company you're interviewing with
        - Know their competitors
        - Know technologies that they are invested in or using
        - Know their history, how do they originate, how have they been progressing, what do you think the next steps are?
    - If it's a larger company, _expect_ Algorithms and Data structures questions
        - Be relatively comfortable with the limitations and use cases of data structures
        - Be prepared to give some Big-O analyses
    - Be prepared to write some code or build a project live
        - Practice using leetcode/codewars/kattis, or making a project from scratch with _No googling and No AI_
            - Bonus points if you only use notepad (NO IDE!)
        - Your solution doesn't have to be perfectly efficient (bonus points if it is) 
            - it needs to run, be correct, and you need to be able to talk someone through it in plain english
    - Curate your portfolio for the position, if it's a web dev position, put your web projects front and center.

Portfolio building
    - Hold onto all of your projects and keep them in a centralized location
    - These will be talking points in conversation as well as 
    - Choose your favorite ones to showcase on a webpage: you should know these inside and out and be ready for in-depth conversations around them

Find your niche
    - There are a bunch of jobs out there, and it can be overwhelming considering them all
    - Additionally, doing something you hate is a good way to burn out
    - But doing something you love could buy you a few more years of work
        - Figure out what you enjoy and don't enjoy (this can change over time!)
        - Find causes that you care about, and look for jobs within/around those causes
        - Take a variety of classes, get interested, do projects outside of class
    - Picking somewhere you want to live can help filter opportunities
        - If you want to live in Maine, narrow your search to Maine jobs!

Resume-building
    - Work with the career center
    - Bring your portfolio so that you can talk about those projects and put them in your resume
    - Tailor your resume for the job you're applying to
